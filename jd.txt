TCS has been making continuous efforts to promote interaction with researchers in academic institutions around the world. We invite graduate / post-graduate / doctoral students as part of the TCS Research Internship program to take up challenging assignments and gain an understanding of industrial research. TCS innovation labs conduct applied research in diverse areas like Software engineering, Process engineering, Systems research, Software models, Cybernetics, Computational Biology, Embedded systems, Security, Automotive engineering, multi-media & Entertainment, Natural Language and Wireless systems. Researchers try to solve real world problems related to our customer business needs and challenges. We believe that this internship experience will complement your academic approach to research. You will also have a good chance to interact with some of the best minds in industrial research and understand new research directions. Our Chief Technology Officer has been recognized by industry as one of the Top 25 CTOs in the world. We have a Corporate Technology Board (CTB) which consists of thirteen of the best technology leaders in the industry. These technologists have demonstrated thought leadership through years of sustained contributions to business, research, industry, academia and society
